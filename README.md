# Case for PlainDAC and Raspberry Pi ZERO

![alt tag](https://polyvection.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ZERO_wo_top.jpg)

In this repository you can find a very slim case for RPi ZERO and our PlainDAC.
There are two STL files that are suitable for 3D printing.

Because some printers have problems with edge curling we have added a 20mm circle on each corner.
Just cust them off after printing is finished.

The STL files were created using DesignSpark Mechanical. So if you want to modify the case you can find the matching .rsdoc files in the corresponding folder.
